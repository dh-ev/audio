The Oréau French Emotional Database was recorded within the scope of the Oréau project.

The complete database (version 1) was evaluated in a perception test regarding the recognisability of emotions and their naturalness. Utterances recognised better than 50% and
judged as natural by listeners were retained, which constitutes the second version of database (OréauFR_02).

After deleting records which  fails  to  meet  this  criteria  and  deleting  of  words which  can  sometimes  lead  to  a  semantic  bias, the final number of recordings retained by emotion is as follows :

- sadness (55)
- anger (67)
- disgust (67)
- fear (51)
- surprise (62)
- joy (62)  
- neutral (70).

--> 434 utterances out of 502 were retained in this version.
